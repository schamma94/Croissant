        The croissant originated in Austria as the "kipferl," a crescent-shaped
        pastry created in the 17th century to celebrate the victory over the
        Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. It was brought to France
        in the late 18th century, where it evolved into the modern croissant we
        know today. The French added more butter and refined the pastry, giving
        it its signature flaky and buttery texture. While the croissant is now
        closely associated with French cuisine, its roots can be traced back to
        Austria, where it was initially created to symbolise the crescent moon
        on the Ottoman Empire's flag.
